## Next Steps

Whew! That was quite a lot to cover throughout this guide, but hopefully, this series helped to illustrate how any type of app -- from this relatively simple `dgraph-twitter-clone` to a large-scale, distributed system -- can realize significant benefits by integrating with a graph database like Dgraph.

In [Schema]({{% ref "/#creating-the-schema" %}}) we explored how Dgraph's schema specification makes it easy to design complex data structures _without_ the need to define (or even know about) explicit relationships. This flexibility allows your data layer to be dynamically expanded and mutate to the needs of the application over time. In fact, Dgraph has no problem accepting data with unknown predicates and automatically adding them to the schema for future use! Check out the [Schema documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#schema) for more details.

In the [Creating a Search Component](#creating-a-search-component) section we also explored how Dgraph's GraphQL+- makes it easy to execute performant joins and reverse joins across any shape of data. With features like [reverse edges](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#reverse-edges), [powerful indexing](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing), [filter logic](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#connecting-filters), [query](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#query-variables) and [value](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#value-variables) variables, [GroupBy](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#groupby), and much more, Dgraph eliminates many of the potential headaches found when trying to perform complex joins across large datasets within traditional SQL-like databases. Head over to the [Query Language](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/) documentation to get tons more info on GraphQL+- and how it can streamline your data layer.

There's plenty more to learn about how Dgraph can benefit your team and your next project, so check out some of the [benefits](https://dgraph.io/), see how to [get started](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/), take our [interactive tour](https://tour.dgraph.io/), chat with us on our [discussion forums](https://discuss.dgraph.io/), or even throw us a [star on GitHub](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph) if you're so inclined. If you're ready to get more direct support and see how Dgraph engineers can help you, check out our [Startup and Enterprise Support](https://dgraph.io/support) plans or [get in touch](mailto:contact@dgraph.io?subject=I%20would%20like%20to%20sign%20up%20for%20the%20Enterprise%20Package) directly.
