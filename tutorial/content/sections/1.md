## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of a Twitter clone application created using the power of a Dgraph data layer. It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end client application. However, before we begin, there are a handful of prerequisites to install or simply to be aware of.

#### Installing Dgraph

You'll need the Dgraph cluster installed, either locally or via an accessible Docker container. This entire application was created while running Dgraph on Docker, which can be installed using the [Docker Compose](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/#docker-compose) file [found here](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/#docker-compose). Alternatively, feel free to install Dgraph in whatever manner best suits your needs. Check out the [official documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/#step-1-install-dgraph) for more details.

#### Installing Node

The Dgraph Twitter Clone app relies heavily on Node.js, so you'll also need Node locally installed. Visit the [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download the correct version for your OS.

#### Using TypeScript

All the code throughout the `dgraph-twitter-clone` project is written with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which is a superset of plain JavaScript that provides typing and other quality of life features for creating cleaner code. While you won't need to be particularly familiar with TypeScript to follow along with this tutorial, be aware that some of the code syntax used throughout the series is TypeScript-specific. Ultimately, all TypeScript code is converted into normal JavaScript prior to execution, so there's nothing in this guide that couldn't have been created in plain JavaScript at the outset.

### Application Architecture

Before we dig into the code let's take a moment to define what the goal of our application is and roughly how it's structured to accomplish that goal. This application aims to illustrate how Dgraph can simplify the structure and lower the development time of a real-world application. While this application is just a proof of concept and far from production-ready software, the overall goal of the `dgraph-twitter-clone` is to create a solid foundation for a Twitter-like front-end application that is powered by Dgraph.

Furthermore, since graph databases are not as well-known as relational databases, the secondary goal of our app is to provide some keystone familiarity for those readers coming from a relational database background. The app illustrates how a "traditional" relational database might handle the app data, while then taking it a step further and showing how that data can be more easily queried and manipulated with a graph database like Dgraph. The following are a few key components we've used to accomplish those goals and to build a functional Twitter clone application.

#### Models

As you're undoubtedly aware, Twitter's functionality largely revolves around just two simple pieces of data: **Tweets** and **Users.** A user has something to say, so they create a tweet, publishing it for other users to consume. Additionally, **Hashtags** are also a fundamental piece of Twitter data, even though they are considered secondary citizens to the parent tweet element. Therefore, this application has a model to represent those three critical pieces of information.

#### Dgraph Adapter

We need to manipulate data on our Dgraph server. Dgraph's official [dgraph-js-http](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph-js-http) package provides a useful API for HTTP-based transactions and mutations. Our application uses `dgraph-js-http`, but we've also added a simple adapter that helps to transform our model data into a format Dgraph understands.

#### GraphQL+-

Dgraph's [GraphQL+- query language](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/) was developed to bring much of the power of Facebook's popular [GraphQL](https://graphql.github.io/) to graph databases, while simultaneously adding features that better suit the specific needs of graph databases. A fundamental component of GraphQL+- is the **query**. [Queries for Dgraph](https://docs.dgraph.io/design-concepts/#queries) are used to retrieve and manipulate data, just like queries in relational databases.

For example, the following query uses the `eq` function to find all nodes with a `user.screenName` equal to `GabeStah`.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{{< runnable >}}
{
  user(func: eq(user.screenName, "GabeStah"))
  {
    uid
    user.screenName
    count(user.friends)
    user.description
  }
}
{{</ runnable >}}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Since our query specifies exactly the data we want to return, we only retrieve the unique identifier, screen name, friends count, and description of the user. The returned data should look something like the following.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": [
      {
        "uid": "0x19",
        "user.screenName": "GabeStah",
        "count(user.friends)": 7,
        "user.description": "At consequatur eos dolores adipisci omnis. Molestiae facere delectus quaerat ratione velit temporibus. Enim eligendi tempora provident accusamus laboriosam. Dolores saepe natus est qui velit sapiente non odit cupiditate. Soluta sint quos minima voluptatem voluptas odio rerum rerum. Blanditiis dicta placeat vitae aut doloribus."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

{{% notice "tip" %}} This tutorial will barely scratch the surface of what GraphQL+- is capable of. Head over to the [official documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/) to learn more about its features and syntax! {{% /notice %}}

#### Front-end React Client

Our app also has a front-end site that loosely emulates Twitter. For this project, we've used the [React](https://reactjs.org) JavaScript library to create our Twitter clone single-page application. You don't need any prior React experience to follow along with this tutorial, but we've also taken advantage of the new [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) feature introduced to React in early 2019, so you'll be able to learn a bit about how those work.

Since our Twitter clone app is primarily focused on how Dgraph and graph databases can be used for a Twitter-esque application, the front-end portion is rather limited in scope -- we have just enough there to lay the groundwork and show how it all integrates together.

#### Back-end Express API

To help illustrate how a relational database typically handles Twitter-like data we've also added a simple API to our application. In fact, as you'll soon see, we've created an app that can transition between using REST API endpoints and GraphQL+- queries with the flip of a configuration flag.

We've taken it one step further and allowed our API to act as a middleware between the front-end client and Dgraph. This will help illustrate how a real-world application might gain a tremendous benefit from exposing simple endpoints to users or other applications, while simultaneously querying and manipulating the underlying data within a graph database like Dgraph.

---

With all the basic components planned out let's just right into the code for our `dgraph-twitter-clone` application!

### Installing the App Locally

The [`dgraph-twitter-clone`](https://github.com/GabeStah/dgraph-twitter-clone) application can be installed and configured in just a few steps. This will allow you to see the app in action and start tinkering with the code yourself so you'll get an idea of how easy it is to power modern applications with Dgraph.

1.  Starting by cloning the [`dgraph-twitter-clone`](https://github.com/GabeStah/dgraph-twitter-clone) Git repository to a local directory.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/GabeStah/dgraph-twitter-clone.git
    $ cd dgraph-twitter-clone
    ```

2.  Make sure Dgraph Alpha is installed and running (see the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)). By default the Dgraph Alpha server is available at `localhost:8080`, but if you changed this endpoint during your installation, you'll need to update the configuration to match your setup. To do so open the `packages/dgraph-query-manager/src/config/development.ts` file and change the `dgraph.adapter.address` to your Dgraph Alpha server endpoint.

    ```ts
    // File: packages/dgraph-query-manager/src/config/development.ts
    const development = {
      dgraph: {
        adapter: {
          address: 'http://localhost:8080',
        },
      },
    };
    ```

3.  Now to perform a full build simply run the `yarn run build` command from the `dgraph-twitter-clone` root directory.

    {{% notice "warning" %}} The `yarn run build` command will **drop all existing data** from your Dgraph database. If you prefer to keep your existing Dgraph data, please run the `yarn run build:safe` command instead, which _will not_ drop data, and will only add additional schema and data. {{% /notice %}}

    ```bash
    $ yarn run build
    ```

    This command will install a few global Node packages (`gulp-cli` and `yalc`), install all required local Node packages for the API and Client apps, transpile TypeScript source files into executable CommonJS, connect to Dgraph, add the new schema, and finally generate the initial dummy data used by the `dgraph-twitter-clone` app. This process will take a couple of minutes and may appear to hang during the `db:generate` step, but the output should look something like the following.

    ```

    {{% notice "tip" %}} The [Yalc](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc) package provides us the ability to install local node package dependencies without the need to publish them to the public NPM repo. We use Yalc to make local project copies of the **DgraphQueryManager** package, which is particularly useful within the client application. Since the client is based on a [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) configuration it cannot access Node packages outside of the project directory, so Yalc helps to get around this limitation. {{% /notice %}}

4.  With everything installed you can now run the **Client** and/or **API** apps with `yarn run start`.

    ```bash
    $ yarn run start
    yarn run v1.13.0
    $ gulp start
    [16:57:04] Requiring external module @babel/register
    [16:57:04] Using gulpfile ~/projects/dgraph-twitter-clone/gulpfile.babel.js
    [16:57:04] Starting 'start'...
    [16:57:04] Starting 'api:start'...
    [16:57:04] Starting 'client:start'...
    ```

    The React client should open in a new browser tab automatically. If not, manually browse to the client app at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

    {{< figure src="/images/client-index.png" link="/images/client-index.png" alt="Client Home Page" >}}

    {{% notice "tip" %}} Throughout this tutorial the packaging tool [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) will be referenced and used. This is just my personal preference, so you are free to substitute `npm` commands in place of `yarn` commands and everything will function the same. {{% /notice %}}

5.  The API should also be running at `localhost:5000`. You can access it via an endpoint such as [`localhost:5000/api/tweets/10`](http://localhost:5000/api/tweets/10):

    ```json
    $ curl localhost:5000/api/tweets/10 | jq
    {
      "statusCode": 200,
      "success": true,
      "uri": "",
      "message": "tweets found.",
      "request": "query find($count: int = 10) {\n      data(func: has (tweet.text), first: $count) {\n        uid\n        expand(_all_) {\n          uid\n          expand(_all_)\n        }\n      }\n     }",
      "response": [

              ],
              "hashtag.hashtag": "parsing"
            },
            {
              "uid": "0x30ca8",
              "hashtag.indices": [

            }
          ],
          "~user.favorites": [

              "user.email": "Nina_Lynch98@example.com"
            },

          ],
          "~user.retweets": [
            {
              "uid": "0x30c7b",
              "user.location": "O'Connellport, Bhutan",

              "user.screenName": "Cierra65"
            }
          ]
        },
      ]
    }
    ```

6.  Better yet, you can skip the API and access Dgraph directly. Running the following query will return the same results as the API endpoint above.

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    {{< runnable >}}
    {
      data(func: has (tweet.text), first: 10) {
        uid
        expand(_all_) {
          uid
          expand(_all_)
        }
      }
    }
    {{< /runnable >}}

    {{% notice "tip" %}} This tutorial will feature many executable Dgraph query snippets similar to the above. If your Dgraph Alpha server is running at the default location (`localhost:8080`) and you [installed](#installing-the-app-locally) the schema for the `dgraph-twitter-clone` you can execute these runnable queries in the browser and receive output from your own Dgraph installation. If your installation is running elsewhere, feel free to manually adjust the endpoint field in the runnable dialog box to send the query to that location. {{% /notice %}}

### Creating the Schema

Before we dive into the code let's briefly look at the schema our Twitter app is using. As discussed, we're working with tweets, users, and hashtags, so we cover all three primary elements in the full schema found below.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
{{< runnable uri="alter" >}}
hashtag.indices: [int] .
hashtag.hashtag: string @index(exact, fulltext) @count .
tweet.createdAt: dateTime @index(hour) .
tweet.hashtag: uid @count @reverse .
tweet.inReplyToStatusId: uid @count .
tweet.inReplyToUserId: uid @count .
tweet.isQuoteStatus: bool .
tweet.quotedStatus: uid @count .
tweet.text: string @index(fulltext) @count @upsert .
tweet.user: uid @count @reverse .
user.avatar: string .
user.createdAt: dateTime @index(hour) .
user.description: string @index(fulltext) @count .
user.email: string @index(exact) @upsert .
user.favorites: uid @count @reverse .
user.friends: uid @count @reverse .
user.location: string @index(term) @count .
user.name: string @index(hash) @count .
user.retweets: uid @count @reverse .
user.screenName: string @index(term) @count .
user.url: string @index(exact, fulltext) @count .
{{< /runnable >}}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Posting this schema to the `/alter` endpoint of Dgraph should return a `{ "code": "Success", "message": "Done" }` object to indicate the schema was altered. The Dgraph schema defines the data **types** for each given **predicate** using a `predicate: type [@directive(s)]` format. For example, here's a break down of the `tweet.text` predicate specification in the schema above.

```text
tweet.text: string @index(fulltext) @count @upsert .
^           ^      ^      ^         ^      ^       ^
|           |      |      |         |      |       end-of-line
|           |      |      |         |      directive
|           |      |      |         directive
|           |      |      tokenizer
|           |      directive
|           type
predicate
```

- The `tweet.text` predicate is essentially the data field that we're defining. In this case, anytime we want to perform a query or mutation that interacts with the _text_ of a Tweet we'll be using this `tweet.text` predicate.
- The [`@index`](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#indexing) directive tells Dgraph to index the predicate based on the passed `tokenizer(s)`. In this case, our data type of `string` allows us to perform a full-text search, which will be useful later so users can easily search through Tweets.
- The `@count` directive tells Dgraph to index the _number_ of edges with this predicate, so we can query the number of tweets, perhaps based on filters like the user that authored those tweets.
- The [`@upsert` directive](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#upsert-directive) enables conflict checking when committing a transaction. While this still requires business logic on our part, it can be useful to help prevent duplicate entries under certain circumstances.

The schema specification is quite in-depth, so check out the [official schema documentation](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#schema) for more details.

{{% notice "tip" %}} While most of the query samples we'll be using throughout this guide can be executed directly in the browser, your Dgraph installation likely also included the Ratel UI, which provides a beautiful interface for performing queries and mutations on your Dgraph server. Feel free to manually copy any of the queries throughout this tutorial and execute them directly within Ratel, which is typically located at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). {{% /notice %}}
