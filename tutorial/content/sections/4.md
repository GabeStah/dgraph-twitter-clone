## Handling Application State

State management is one of the most difficult and initially confusing aspects of a new React app, so in this section we'll see how the new [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) feature added to React in early 2019 can be used to create a stateful and elegant single-page application powered by a Dgraph database for fast and efficient data management. Let's dive in!

You are encouraged to install the `dgraph-twitter-clone/client` application in a local dev environment so you can test it out and see the code in action as we walk through it. If you haven't done so, feel free to check out the [installation]({{% ref "/#installing-the-app-locally" %}}) instructions. Alternatively, if you already installed the `dgraph-twitter-clone` repo and have Dgraph up and running, you can start the client app by executing the `npm start` or `yarn start` command from the `dgraph-twitter-clone/client` directory.

{{% notice "tip" %}} React is a powerful library that is capable of creating some extremely complex architectures, so feel free to check out the [official documentation](https://reactjs.org/) to learn more about the concepts we'll be discussing here. {{% /notice %}}

{{% notice "warning" %}} The `dgraph-twitter-clone/client` was created by a programmer who is a rather poor designer, so this project is definitely function over form. To that end, the basic React app was bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/), which creates a skeleton React app with most of the build tools added and handled out of the box. The look and styling are largely based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), which only seems appropriate given that this is a Twitter clone. Ultimately, as discussed in the introduction, the goal of the client app is to illustrate how easily a graph database like Dgraph can integrate into a modern Twitter-like application, and how much power its many features such as GraphQL+- queries bring to the table. {{% /notice %}}

### Instantiating the App

Let's start looking through the client code at the top where our app is initialized, and we'll work our way down from there. The `client/src/index.tsx` [file](https://github.com/GabeStah/dgraph-twitter-clone/blob/master/client/src/index.tsx) invokes the React app and renders the primary `App` component, which is [found](https://github.com/GabeStah/dgraph-twitter-clone/blob/master/client/src/App.tsx) in `client/src/App.tsx`.

```tsx
// File: client/src/index.tsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

```tsx
// File: client/src/App.tsx
// Components
import Main from './components/Main/Main';
// Hooks
// Layout
import './App.css';
// Libs
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import React from 'react';
// Local
import { Reducer } from './reducers';
import { InitialState, StateProvider } from './state';
// Fonts
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';
import { far } from '@fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons';
import { fas } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

library.add(far);
library.add(fas);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <StateProvider initialState={InitialState} reducer={Reducer}>
        <Main />
      </StateProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

export default App;
```

The `App` component wraps our entire application in the `BrowserRouter` component middleware, which comes from the [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) package and allows us to perform routing by rendering certain components based on requested URL paths. We'll get into that more in just a moment.

### Adding a State Provider

The `StateProvider` component is a custom component based on [this post](https://medium.com/simply/state-management-with-react-hooks-and-context-api-at-10-lines-of-code-baf6be8302c) and code by Luke Hall.

```tsx
// File: client/src/state/StateProvider.tsx
/**
 * Author: Luke Hall
 * Source: https://medium.com/simply/state-management-with-react-hooks-and-context-api-at-10-lines-of-code-baf6be8302c
 */
import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react';
import { InitialState } from './State';

export const StateContext = createContext(InitialState);
export const StateProvider = ({ reducer, initialState, children }) => (
  <StateContext.Provider value={useReducer(reducer, initialState)}>
    {children}
  </StateContext.Provider>
);
export const useStateContext = () => useContext(StateContext);
```

This component provides global state throughout the application by using the [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) React hook. [**Context**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) is how React handles "global" state. As the [React Context.Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider) documentation shows, a context provider passes its value down to any child components that _consume_ it. This is often a sleeker pattern to passing down large chains of props through a big component tree.

In the `StateProvider` component above, we're passing the returned values from the [`useReducer`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) React hook down to the child components to consume. `useReducer()` is similar to the `useState()` hook, except it works with the **reducer + action + dispatcher** pattern found in common React libraries like [Redux](https://redux.js.org). Why use **reducers** instead of directly modifying **state**? The primary advantage is a separation of concerns. Rather than allowing our state to be directly mutable, we can instead **dispatch** a series of **actions** that tell the **reducer** to change the state in some way.

### Working with Actions and Reducers

To understand how actions and reducers work in conjunction to change our application state let's first look at how we're storing our state throughout most of our app. This is accomplished in the `client/src/state/State.ts` file.

```ts
// File: client/src/state/State.ts
import { Tweet, User } from 'dgraph-query-manager';

export const InitialState: any = {
  authUser: undefined,
  searchResults: undefined,
  user: undefined,
  tweets: [],
};

export interface StateInterface {
  authUser: User | undefined;
  searchResults: any;
  user: User | undefined;
  tweets: Tweet[];
}

export class State implements StateInterface {
  authUser: User | undefined;
  searchResults: undefined;
  user: User | undefined;
  tweets: Tweet[];
}
```

As you can see, we've defined a `StateInterface` with a handful of properties and we implement that `StateInterface` in the `State` class. We're also importing the `User` and `Tweet` models from `dgraph-query-manager` since we want to use those model objects throughout the application. The properties of `State` don't mean a lot right now, but we'll mutate the values of this class in our reducer below based on changes within the app.

Next let's look at the potential actions our reducer can expect, which are found in the `client/src/reducers/base/Action.ts` [file](https://github.com/GabeStah/dgraph-twitter-clone/blob/master/client/src/reducers/base/Action.ts).

```ts
// File: client/src/reducers/base/Action.ts
export enum ActionType {
  SET_AUTHENTICATED_USER,
  SET_SEARCH_RESULTS,
  SET_USER,
  SET_TWEETS,
  UPDATE_TWEET,
  TOGGLE_TWEET_PROPERTY,
}

export interface ActionInterface {
  payload: any | undefined;
  type: ActionType;
}

export class Action implements ActionInterface {
  payload: any | undefined;
  type: ActionType;

  constructor(type: ActionType, payload?: any) {
    this.type = type;
    this.payload = payload;
  }
}
```

As mentioned above, the purpose of a reducer to change state is that it accepts an action and, based on what that action tells it, makes changes to the state. **Critically**, a reducer is meant to be [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), meaning repeated calls to the same reducer with the same arguments should _always_ result in the same outcome. Another common term for this type of code is a **pure function**. Simply put, your reducer logic should have no side effects.

So, our simple `Action` class accepts an `ActionType`, which is an enum of explicit options. It also accepts an optional payload, which will be used for additional parameters when necessary.

Now let's see how the reducer uses our `Action` and `State` class to mutate application state by [checking out](https://github.com/GabeStah/dgraph-twitter-clone/blob/master/client/src/reducers/base/Reducer.ts) `client/src/reducers/base/Reducer.ts`.

```ts
// File: client/src/reducers/base/Reducer.ts
import { Action, ActionType } from './Action';
import { State } from '../../state/';
import { Uid } from 'dgraph-query-manager';
import * as _ from 'lodash';

export const Reducer = (state: State, action: Action): State => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ActionType.SET_AUTHENTICATED_USER: {
      return {
        ...state,
        authUser: action.payload,
      };
    }

    case ActionType.SET_SEARCH_RESULTS: {
      return {
        ...state,
        searchResults: action.payload,
      };
    }

    case ActionType.SET_USER: {
      return {
        ...state,
        user: action.payload,
      };
    }

    case ActionType.UPDATE_TWEET: {
      if (!state.tweets) return state;
      const index = state.tweets.findIndex(
        tweet => tweet.uid === action.payload.uid
      );
      const tempTweets = state.tweets;
      // Update passed Tweet.
      tempTweets[index] = action.payload;
      return {
        ...state,
        tweets: tempTweets,
      };
    }

    case ActionType.SET_TWEETS: {
      return {
        ...state,
        // If array, sort in descending order.
        tweets: Array.isArray(action.payload)
          ? action.payload.sort(
              (a, b) =>
                +new Date(b['tweet.createdAt']) -
                +new Date(a['tweet.createdAt'])
            )
          : [action.payload],
      };
    }

    case ActionType.TOGGLE_TWEET_PROPERTY: {
      const isEnabled = action.payload.isEnabled;
      const property = action.payload.property;
      const tweet = action.payload.tweet;
      const user = action.payload.user;

      const clone = _.clone(tweet);

      if (!_.has(clone, property)) {
        clone[property] = [];
      } else if (!_.isArray(clone[property])) {
        clone[property] = [clone[property]];
      }
      if (isEnabled) {
        clone[property].push(user);
      } else {
        clone[property] = _.reject(
          clone[property],
          other =>
            new Uid(other.uid).toString() === new Uid(user.uid).toString()
        );
      }

      return {
        ...state,
        tweets: _.map(state.tweets, original => {
          return original.uid.toString() === tweet.uid.toString()
            ? clone
            : original;
        }),
      };
    }

    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

The `Reducer` class accepts two arguments: the current `State` and an `Action` instance. Based on the `ActionType` of the passed `Action` it modifies the state in some way and returns the **new state** object. Nothing too crazy going on here.

Now, if we look back at the `StateProvider` component, and specifically how it passes the returned values from `useReducer()` as the `StateProvider.Provider` `value`, you can start to see what's going on.

```tsx
// File: client/src/state/StateProvider.tsx
export const StateContext = createContext(InitialState);
export const StateProvider = ({ reducer, initialState, children }) => (
  <StateContext.Provider value={useReducer(reducer, initialState)}>
    {children}
  </StateContext.Provider>
);
export const useStateContext = () => useContext(StateContext);
```

A call to the `useReducer()` hook returns two values: The current state and a `dispatch` function. The dispatch function is invoked whenever you need to call the reducer and pass it a new action to perform. We'll go over this component in more detail in the [TweetBox](#tweet-box) section, but here is a snippet from that component code that shows how we're retrieving `State` properties. After destructuring the `tweets` state value we later call the `dispatch` function and pass in a new `Action` instance to inform the reducer what it should do -- in this case, to `SET_TWEETS` to the array passed as the `payload` argument.

```ts
// File: client/src/components/Tweet/TweetBox.tsx
const [{ authUser, user, tweets }, dispatch] = useStateContext();
// ...
dispatch(
  new Action(ActionType.SET_TWEETS, [...tweets, serialization.response])
);
```
